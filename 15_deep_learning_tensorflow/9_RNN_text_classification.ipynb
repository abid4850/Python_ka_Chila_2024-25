Although, only 15 minutes long, Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time. Bud Tingwell gives a touching performance as Will, a widower struggling to cope with his wife's death. Will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of Ruth's pet cow, Tulip. The film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost. Good cinematography, great direction, and superbly acted. It will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one, and survived."

Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn\\'t all that funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that\\'s all this film has going for it.

His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.\"\n",

    "To complete this exercise, you should modify this notebook to work with the Stack Overflow dataset by making the following modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. At the top of your notebook, update the code that downloads the IMDB dataset with code to download the Stack Overflow dataset that has already been prepared. As the Stack Overflow dataset has a similar directory structure, you will not need to make many modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. Modify the last layer of your model to Dense(4), as there are now four output classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. When compiling the model, change the loss to tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True). This is the correct loss function to use for a multi-class classification problem, when the labels for each class are integers (in this case, they can be 0, 1, 2, or 3). In addition, change the metrics to metrics=['accuracy'], since this is a multi-class classification problem (tf.metrics.BinaryAccuracy is only used for binary classifiers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. When plotting accuracy over time, change binary_accuracy and val_binary_accuracy to accuracy and val_accuracy, respectively.\n",
    "- 5. Once these changes are complete, you will be able to train a multi-class classifier"
